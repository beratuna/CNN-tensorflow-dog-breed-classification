# CNNtensorflow

Used Dog breed identification data from kaggle to develop a dog breed Image recognition system.

Implemented two models on data:

     1. Developed a model from scratch with Image Augmentations using Tensorflow.

     2. Implemented transfer learning on data using the pretrained VGG16 weights. Made predictions on feature vectors using
        ML algorithms like PCA and SVM.
